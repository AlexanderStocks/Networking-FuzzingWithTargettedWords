# Networking-FuzzingWithTargettedWords

In my fifth instalment in my series of networking projects I will be writing extensions for Burp Suite.  Burp suite is a web vulnerability scanner that can be used to perform attacks against web-based applications.  

The first extension I will write is one that intercepts a HTTP request and uses it as the input to a fuzzer that can be run in Burp. The second will use the bing API to show all hosts located on the target IP address, as well as detecting any sub-domains.
